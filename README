To create a firefox addon:

1. Add all files to a zip archive. Something like Select All -> Compress
N.B. DO NOT zip up the folder in which these files are located. Just zip up the files.

2. Rename the zip extension to .xpi

3. Drag and drop the .xpi into Firefox

Put the RSA publickey of the webnotary server at the top of tlsn.js in var notaryserver_modulus.
The pubkey must be an array of numbers. 
The webnotary is expected on localhost:8081
